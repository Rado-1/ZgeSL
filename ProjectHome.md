**ZgeSL** is an Android sound library to play MP3 or OGG files for the [ZGameEditor](http://www.zgameeditor.org) (ZGE). It is created as a wrapper for OpenSL. The main purpose is to adapt the original C++ interface to the type system of ZGE.

The project contains also **Common Music Library** (**CML**) which provides a common API to ZgeSL for Android, and Media Control Interface (MCI) for Windows. It is used to play just MP3 files on both operating systems.
