# ZgeSL

**ZgeSL** is an Android sound library to play MP3 or OGG files for the [ZGameEditor](http://www.zgameeditor.org) (ZGE). It is created as a wrapper for OpenSL. The main purpose is to adapt the original C++ interface to the type system of ZGE.

The project contains also **Common Music Library** (**CML**) which provides a common API to ZgeSL for Android, and Media Control Interface (MCI) for Windows. It is used to play just MP3 files on both operating systems.

ZgeSL is free for commercial use and open source under the Zlib License.
